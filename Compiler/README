Potential Errors
 - Calculating booleans return a 0 (false) or >0(true). Some boolean expressions will evaluate to very small positive floats for a true value.
    If this expression is to be assigned to a variable of integer type then when the boolean value is converted from a float to an int,
    it looses its true value and becomes false.
